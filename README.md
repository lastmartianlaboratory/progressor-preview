Description
-

A simple time-tracking application that is currently being developed for personal use. The project is being developed mainly using Unity3D/C#. Some extensions require the use of APIs/frameworks outside of the Unity3D ecosystem.
The repository is stripped down to the scripts only and is provided as a very limited code showcase.

⚠️ The repository is available only temporarily and will be removed soon.
Do not distribute.
